# Python---Titanic-Prediction---Model-Comparison

This Project was to compare three different model performance on the same data from the kaggle Competition dataset - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The train dataset and test dataset were provided which needed some cleaning before building any model. I have tried to document as I went along.

Here we used three models trained by the same training data set to get accuracies and print confusion matrix

The models build here are 
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. SVM Classifier
3. Artificial Neural Network

The code is available here [Titanic_code](https://github.com/Atheros167/Python---TItanic-Prediction---Model-Comparison/blob/master/Titanic%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)

Here are the results for each of the models

1. Logistic Regression had a accuracy of about 80% of train dataset 
2. SVM - Classifier had an accuracy of 59% 
3. ANN had an accuracy of 81%

I will add a few more models such as Decision Trees as well when I get to it.
