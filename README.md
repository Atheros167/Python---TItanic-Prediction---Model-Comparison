# Python---Titanic-Prediction---Model-Comparison

This Project was to compare three different model performance on the same model on the data from the kaggle Competition dataset - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

Here we used three models trained by the same training data set to get accuracies and print confusion matrix

The models build here are 
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. SVM Classifier
3. Artificial Neural Network

The code is available here [Titanic_code](https://github.com/Atheros167/Python---TItanic-Prediction---Model-Comparison/blob/master/Titanic%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)
